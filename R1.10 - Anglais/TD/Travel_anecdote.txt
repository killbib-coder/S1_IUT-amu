During an old holiday I traveled in Italy. I was going to enter the coliseum. At the time of checking the bags, the security guards stopped me because they found something in my bag that is not allowed. 
Really ?
Yes ! I didn't know why they stopped me and when they told me, they spoke in Italian so I didn't understand. 
It must have been complicated ! 
They searched for a few minutes and started getting mad at me. The unauthorized object was a knife that I had forgotten in my bag and which was hidden in a pocket of my bag. Since I had forgotten that I had put a knife in my bag, I couldn't help them look for what wasn't allowed in my bag. 
Oh no !
They thought that I wanted to pass by with a knife to commit a crime.
Thatâ€™s terrible ! What happened ?
Since I was young, they took the knife and put it in the trash. The teachers I was traveling with weren't happy but nothing more happened.
