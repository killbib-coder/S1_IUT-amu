In the beginning on the video, Peter parker is pensive.
He just did something stupid. Because of him, several people were in danger.

His suits was given to him by Tony Stark and he disabled the "baby throtter" who was a child safety mod on the suit.
Because of that, Tony Stark was very angry. In addition to that, the suit was very expensive. Tony says "a multi-dollars suits".
Tony had warned Peter and Peter did "the one thing i told you not to do" as Tony says.
Peter gets mad and he thinks that Tony Stark isn't in his armor. But there is.
Then Tony will ask Peter to give him back the spider-man suits "for ever".
When Peter is going to beg Tony not to get back the armor, he say that he is nothing without it.
Tony Stark is going to make a reference to one of his movies when he answers "If you nothing without this suit, then you shouldn't haven".
He make a reference because he didn't need his armor to save people in Iron Man 3. 

I choose this Spider-man Homecoming video clip beacause in this clip, Tony and Peter are like father and son or master and apprentice.
Peter lost his dad when he was young and Tony hasn't children in this movie and he went through the same thing as Peter. Tony says "if you die, i feel like that's on me" so he takes care of Peter.
